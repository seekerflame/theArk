# Global Problemsolving Method

**The Global Problemsolving Method** is the core pedagogy of Open Source Ecology, integrating Action Research with the OSE Iron Triangle to achieve industry transformation.

## Meta How-To

1. **Learn everything**: State of the world, technology, history, democracy.
2. **Cross-Subsidize**: Fund transformative work with material production.
3. **Disseminate**: Spread prosperity globally.

## Action Research & Deep Entrepreneurship

Instead of traditional schooling, we "go to school" to solve problems collaboratively. We create **Deep Entrepreneurs**—outsider boundary players who shadow professionals to learn the trade without indoctrination, then start agencies to transform those industries.

### The Shadowing Model

- **Cost**: Pay 30-50% of a student's program.
- **Activity**: Shadow learning, do assignments.
- **Goal**: Gain "Agency" capacity (awareness/insight) to lead transformation.

## Execution Algorithm

1. **Analyze**: Find the best standards and players.
2. **Wiki**: Document via investigative journalism.
3. **Open Source**: Fill technical gaps.
4. **Team**: Build stewardship/advisor contracts.
5. **Fund**: Earned revenue + charity.
6. **Scale**: Launch Open Sector Enterprise.
7. **Solve**: Execute solutions for justice and freedom.
