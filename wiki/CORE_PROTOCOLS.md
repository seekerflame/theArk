# CORE PROTOCOLS (v3.0)

> "A Map of system behavior. The Logic that governs the Node."

## I. SYSTEM SYMBOLS (The Protocol)

*These abstractions guide the coordination of the Node. We utilize Time-Binding to establish a heritage of high-fidelity engineering.*

### 1. The Priority Matrix (Stone Schedule)

| Category | Vector | Target State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Energy** | P0 | Local Solar Mesh / Hydrogen Storage |
| **Production** | P1 | The Foundry / GVCS Infrastructure |
| **Operating System** | P2 | Ark OS Modular Architecture |
| **Coordination** | P3 | 150-Person Federation Logic |

### 2. General Semantics & Engineering Logic

- **Non-Identity Protocol**: A ledger entry represents labor; it is not the human who performed it.
- **Anti-Digital ID Baseline**: We reject biometric/surveillance-linked identity. Your identity is your private key. One User = One Wallet = One Node.
- **The Exit Strategy**: The Ark is designed as an immediate 'Off-Ramp' from centralized fiscal dependency.
- **Reference Orientation**: Value is derived from entropy reduction (work done in time).
- **Time-Binding**: All technical data must be recorded to the Chronicle to enable recursive improvement.

## II. THE TERRITORY: CURRENT NODE STATE

A Node is not a "thing"; it is an **event in time**.

- **Node Status**: Active / Sovereign.
- **Node Identifier**: [ark-os-production.onrender.com](https://ark-os-production.onrender.com)
- **Ledger Density**: 3,900+ Verified Blocks.
- **Hardware Bridge**: LIVE (Solar/Water/Motion).

### Functional Entry Points

- **[[User:Seeker/Abundance_Token/NETWORK_ENTRY|→ Network Entry]]**: Establishing access to the Mesh.
- **[[User:Seeker/Abundance_Token/ECONOMIC_LOGIC|→ Economic Logic]]**: The mechanism of value exchange (AT).
- **[[User:Seeker/Abundance_Token/PRODUCT_ECOLOGY|→ Product Ecology]]**: Map of what is being built in the territory.

### ACTIVE SOPs

- **[[User:Seeker/Abundance_Token/GAP_001|GAP_001]]**: Civilizational Vector
- **[[User:Seeker/Abundance_Token/Mitosis|ECP_001]]**: Cellular Scaling Strategy
- **[[User:Seeker/Abundance_Token/Security|SEC_001]]**: Data Sovereignty Protocols

## III. THE CHRONICLE (Documentation Baseline)

*The source of truth for engineering history.*
