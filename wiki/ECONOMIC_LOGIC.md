# ECONOMIC LOGIC (v3.0)

> "Value is a measurement of work done in time. The Ledger is the Map of that work."

## I. SYSTEM UNIT: AB RECOGNITION (AT)

Value recognition is secured through the **Abundance Token (AT)**.

- **Standard**: 1 AT = 1 Hour of Validated Labor.
- **Context**: [General Semantics] 1 AT represents a unique slice of time-bound human contribution.

## II. THE FEEDBACK LOOP: MINTING

We map value from the Territory (Physical Work) into the Ledger (Digital Signal).

| Input | Logic | Verification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Human Labor** | 1 AT / Hour | Triple-Verification Protocol |
| **Machine Output** | Performance Delta | Hardware Bridge Observation |
| **Technical Quests** | Bounty Baseline | Peer-Reviewed Consensus |

---

## III. THE OUTPUT: PHYSICAL ABUNDANCE

Digital signals (AT) are utilized to trigger physical outcomes in the **Foundry**.

- **Exchange Logic**: Utilizing recognized contribution to acquire physical priority (e.g., housing modules, transit).
- **Recirculation**: AT is a signal of potential, flowing through the community to ensure system resilience.

## IV. RESOURCE ALLOCATION

- **Governance**: Stakeholders participate in resource priority mapping.
- **Identity Integrity**: One human, one signature. No Sybil-interference.
- **Sustainability**: All tokenomics are tied to the **Stone Schedule** (Real-world survival baselines).

**"We map abundance to destroy artificial scarcity."**
