## I. THE INVITATION: ACCESS PROTOCOL

This is a **Production Network**. Access is granted based on the commitment to achieve civilizational baseline stability.

### 1. Capability Progression

We utilize cycles of **Competence Build**:

- **Builder Level**: Direct engagement with the Seed Eco-Home and GVCS components.
- **Journeyman Level**: Maintenance and optimization of Node metabolic flows.
- **Architect Level**: Replicating the Node in new territories using the Mitosis Protocol.

## II. THE RECOGNITION ENGINE

Your engagement is recognized through the Economic Logic of the Ark.

- **1 Hour = 1 AT**.
- **Observation**: Your contribution is mapped to the ledger, creating a reputation baseline in the Mesh.

## III. FEDERATION: THE CELLULAR MODEL

Network scale is achieved through **Mitosis**.

1. **Join a Cell**: Locate or establish a 150-person high-trust group.
2. **Standardize Baselines**: Stabilize Energy, Food, and Shelter.
3. **Partition**: Split into new autonomous cells as trust boundaries are reached.
