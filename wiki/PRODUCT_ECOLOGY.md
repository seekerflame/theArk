# PRODUCT ECOLOGY (v3.0)

> "The Map is not the Territory. This document maps the output of the Forge."

## I. ENGINEERING HERITAGE

We acknowledge the development path established by [Open Source Ecology](https://opensourceecology.org). We refine the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS) for the digital/physical bridge.

## II. THE TERRITORY: ACTIVE BUILD

A Node is a functional event in space-time. Current metrics:

- **Build Status**: Operational.
- **Verification Density**: 3,900+ Blocks.
- **Hardware Integration**: Solar/Water sensor array live.

## III. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Foundation (Sovereignty)

- **[[User:Seeker/Abundance_Token/CORE_PROTOCOLS|→ Core Protocols]]**: Engineering Standards.
- **[[User:Seeker/Abundance_Token/Security|→ Security Core]]**: Cryptographic protection.

### Economic Engine (Abundance)

- **[[User:Seeker/Abundance_Token/ECONOMIC_LOGIC|→ Economic Logic]]**: Labor Mapping (1 AT = 1 Hour).
- **[[User:Seeker/Abundance_Token/Foundry|→ The Foundry]]**: Production management.

### Scaling Vector (Federation)

- **[[User:Seeker/Abundance_Token/Mitosis|→ Mitosis]]**: Cellular replication logic.
- **[[User:Seeker/Abundance_Token/NETWORK_ENTRY|→ Network Entry]]**: Peer onboarding.

## IV. SWARM PROTOCOL: MODULAR BREAKDOWN

The **Swarm Protocol** is the mechanism for parallelizing complexity. Every project in the Forge is decomposed into **Atomic Swarm Blocks**.

### Breakdown Methodology

1. **Blueprint Decomposition**: High-level CAD models are split into discrete sub-assemblies (e.g., Frame, Hydraulics, Control).
2. **Atomic Tasking**: Sub-assemblies are further broken down into 10-20 minute tasks (e.g., "Mount Solenoid A", "Wire Sensor Group 7").
3. **P2P Claiming**: Agents (Human or Robot) claim blocks via the Pip-Boy interface.
4. **Validation**: Completion is verified via Triple Verification (Visual/Peer/AI).

### Social Swarming (Care Circle)

Swarming is not limited to physical building.

- **Care Blocks**: Mentorship, mental health check-ins, and community logistics (e.g., "Verify well-being of Node Segment 3").
- **Intel Blocks**: Design reviews, GPM audits, and documentation hauls.

---

## V. THE OUTPUT: PHYSICAL ABUNDANCE

Digital signals (AT) are utilized to trigger physical outcomes in the **Foundry**.

### Exchange Logic

Utilizing recognized contribution to acquire physical priority (e.g., housing modules, transit).

### Recirculation

AT is a signal of potential, flowing through the community to ensure system resilience.
