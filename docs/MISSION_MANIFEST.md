# Abundance Labs: Mission Manifest (v1.0)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Mission**: Decentralized liberation via self-sufficient nodes.
> **Metric**: $0/month cost of living for 150 people.

## 🏛️ Core Architecture Components

| Module | Identifier | Strategic Role | Status |
|--------|------------|----------------|--------|
| **Ledger** | `village_ledger.db` | Immutable record of labor and value exchange. | 🟢 RELIABLE |
| **Identity** | `core/identity.py` | Sovereign Passport (Mnemonic-based). Anti-WorldID. | 🟢 HARDENED |
| **Economy** | `api/economy.py` | PPP-bridged tokenization of labor (AT). | 🟢 ACTIVE |
| **Justice** | `api/justice.py` | Code audit & vibe-check engine. Prevents grifting. | 🟡 EVOLVING |
| **Academy** | `api/academy.py` | Learn-to-Earn (Product Ecologies). | 🔴 EXPANDING |

## 🕊️ Project Exodus (Anti-Surveillance)

- **Exodus Bridge**: Facilitates migration from fiat/debt systems to autonomous nodes.
- **Sovereign Intel**: Local-first, privacy-preserving intelligence engine (Anti-Palantir).
- **Hardened Vault**: AES-256 encrypted data sales for UBI.

## 🌊 Modular Swarm (Productivity)

- **Swarm Radar**: Real-time sync for community builds (SEED Eco-Home, GVCS).
- **Modular Breakdown**: Decomposition of complex builds into simple, claimable blocks.

## 🍎 The Stone Schedule (Survival)

- **Food**: Greenhouse automation and harvest marketplace.
- **Power**: Solar mesh grid and micro-utility billing.
- **Shelter**: Open-source blueprints and group-buy logistics.

## 📜 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

All intelligent history is logged in the `CHRONICLE` as part of the total recall protocol.

## 💎 The Great Deal: Why AT Wins

| Scarcity (Old World) | Abundance (OSE) | Advantage |
|----------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Fiat/Debt** | **Abundance Token (AT)** | Backed by *real labor*, not interest-bearing debt. |
| **Rent/Mortgage** | **SEED Eco-Home** | $0/month shelter cost after 2-weekend build. |
| **Grid Power** | **Solar Mesh** | Sovereign energy. No utility bills ever. |
| **Retail Food** | **Harvest Market** | Hyper-local nutrient density. Carbon negative. |

### How what we have here helps others

1. **Zero Barrier to Entry**: We don't "sell" education; we unlock **Production Power**.
2. **Instant Liquidity**: Training on the Academy allows you to mint labor value immediately within the node.
3. **Federation Multiplier**: A single node's innovation (e.g., a better hydraulic seal) is instantly available to all other 150-person nodes via the **Spore Protocol**.

*Status: DOCUMENTED. Mission: ADVANCE.*
