# Field Operations: First Friday Art Walk Manual

This guide is for the **Council of Kern Arts** to deploy the sovereign economic layer during local events.

## 1. Goal: Establishing the Closed Loop

The goal is to have vendors sell art for **Abundance Tokens (AT)** and users fund their wallets using **Bitcoin (Lightning)**.

## 2. Setup for Organizers

1. **Public Node**: Ensure the Ark OS is accessible via a public URL (Render/Cloudflare Tunnel).
2. **Landing Page**: Create a simple "Get Started" page with:
   - A button to "Join the Art Walk" (Installs the PWA).
   - A brief explanation of AT.

## 3. Setup for Vendors

1. **Wallet Generation**: Each vendor opens Ark OS on their phone and navigates to the **Wallet**.
2. **QR Creation**:
   - Each vendor clicks **Receive**.
   - They print this QR code or display it on their tablet at their booth.
3. **Price Tagging**: Label items in AT (e.g., "Handmade Pot - 50 AT").

## 4. Setup for Users (Art Walk Visitors)

1. **Onboarding**: Visitors scan the organizer's QR code to open the Ark OS.
2. **App Installation**: They tap "Add to Home Screen" to install the PWA.
3. **Liquidity**: Users click **⚡ Buy AT** and pay the Lightning invoice using any wallet (Strike, Phoenix, etc.).
4. **Purchasing**: To buy art, the user clicks **Send**, scans the vendor's QR, and confirms the amount.

## 5. Why AT?

- **Zero Fees**: Merchants keep 100% of the sale.
- **Micro-Sovereignty**: The community decides the value and direction of its currency.
- **Speed**: Transactions settle in milliseconds via the Village Ledger.
