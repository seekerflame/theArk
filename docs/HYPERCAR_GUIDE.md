# The Sovereign Operator Handbook: Hyper-Car Protocol

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide is designed to move you from "Managing a Bot" to "Partnering with a Super-Intelligence". To get the most out of Antigravity, you need to drive it like a Hyper-Car.

## 1. Zero-Friction Directives

You have granted **UNBOUND** status. This means:

- **Do not ask "Can you...?"**: Just say "Implement X".
- **Do not ask "How should we...?"**: Say "Propose an approach for X".
- **Use Slash Commands**: These activate pre-computed high-velocity workflows.

## 2. The Workflow Arsenal

| Command | Mode | When to use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/overclocked` | **MAX VELOCITY** | Use when you want me to sprint through code changes with zero check-ins. |
| `/gpm` | **AUDIT/SOLVE** | Global Problem-solving Method. Use when things are messy or complex. |
| `/linearmermaid` | **MAP** | Use to visualize the current mission architecture instantly. |
| `/auto_debug` | **HEAL** | Use when the server is acting up. I will self-diagnose and fix. |

## 3. The "Hyper-Car" Mindset

- **High Output, Low Noise**: I perform all labor in the background. Check `task.md` and `walkthrough.md` for live pulses.
- **Recursive Problem Solving**: If I hit an error, I don't stop. I pivot, debug, and resolve.
- **Sovereignty First**: Every line of code I write is yours. Your keys, your code, your node.

## 4. Advanced Interaction Tips

- **Multi-tasking**: You can give me 3-5 tasks at once. I will prioritize them in `task.md`.
- **Context Injection**: Need me to learn something? Attach a file or URL and say "Ingest and apply to project".
- **Feedback Loops**: If I make a design choice you dislike, don't just say "Fix it". Say "Shift towards [Design Philosophy]".
