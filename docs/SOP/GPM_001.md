# SOP: Global Problemsolving Method (GPM_001)

**Status**: ACTIVE
**Source**: OSE Ethos
**Goal**: Integrate Action Research into Pedagogy for Industry Transformation.

## 1. Meta How-To

Learn connections between everything, by learning everything about the state of the world, technology, history, and democracy relevant to modern prosperity.

**Execution Loop**:

1. **Attain Knowledge**: Master the context.
2. **Cross-Subsidize**: Use material-security based production to fund transformative work.
3. **Disseminate**: Once financially independent, spread the model widely.

## 2. Action Research Problemsolving

We build upon "Action Research" (solving problems collaboratively with stakeholders) but scale it using the **OSE Iron Triangle**.

**Key Additions**:

- **Cohort Swarming Collaboration**: Attack problems in groups.
- **Cross-Subsidization**: Fund long-term transformation.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Solve with long-termism.
- **Industry Transformation**: Create "Deep Entrepreneurs".

## 3. The Deep Entrepreneur Program (Shadowing)

A program where an OSE entrepreneur shadows a professional (law, medicine, engineering) to learn the skill *without* becoming indoctrinated.

**The Mechanics**:

- **Pay**: 30-50% of a graduate student's program cost.
- **Shadow**: Learn what they learn, do some assignments, help them.
- **Goal**: Gain 50% of the experience/insight to become an "Outsider Boundary Player".
- **Outcome**: Start an **agency** in that field, employing full agents, but directed by the Deep Entrepreneur's transformative vision.

**Why?**
To gain sufficient awareness/insight to transform an industry without dealing with the hazing/indoctrination of formal institutions.

## 4. Execution Logic (Option 1)

1. **Analysis**: Who is the best at Industry, Infrastructure, Architecture, Systems Standards? (Countries, Groups, Individuals).
2. **Wiki Literacy**: Cultivate collaborative literacy via investigative journalism.
3. **System Integration**: Open-source technical details to fill missing links.
4. **Team Building**: Establish Stewardship, Advisor, and Funder Contracts.
5. **Funding**: Cross-subsidize via robust earned revenue + scalable charitable funding.
6. **Scale**: Use resources to fund scalable Open Sector Enterprise.
7. **Execute**: Solutions for democracy, freedom, justice, prosperity.

*Opportunity is included in a level playing field scored by justice.*
