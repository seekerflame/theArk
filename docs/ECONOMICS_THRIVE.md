# Economics of Thrive: The Time Bank & Global Treasury (v1.0)

## 1. The AT Source: Where does it come from?

The Abundance Token (AT) is not "printed" from thin air. It is a **Time Bank** signal backed by the collective production capacity of the node.

### A. Proof of Labor (The Standard)

1. **Physical Labor**: Direct building of GVCS modules (Shelter, Power, Food). Backed by physical assets.
2. **Intellectual Labor**: Engineering, coding, and design. Backed by efficiency gains.
3. **Social Labor (Care Circle)**: Mental health support, mentorship, and community care. Backed by *system resilience* and *morale*.

### B. The Global Treasury (Collective Surplus)

As the node achieves "Stone Schedule" security ($0/month costs), the surplus energy and materials are tokenized into a **Global Treasury**.

- **Distribution**: This treasury fund the "Care Circle" and "Disabled Support" tasks.
- **Inclusivity**: Those who cannot "build" physically provide the "Social Glue" that prevents Dunbar-mitosis failure.

## 2. Inclusivity for All (Thrive Layer)

| Group | Contribution | Reward Path |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Building Types** | Physical Assembly | Swarm Block Claims (AT) |
| **Intellectuals** | Optimization/GPM | Audit & Documentation (AT) |
| **Caregivers** | Mental/Physical Health | Care Circle Check-ins (AT) |
| **Disabled/Unwell** | Community Pulse | Subjective Wisdom/Art (AT) |

### Mental Health & Wellbeing

The village takes care of its own. Care labor is minted at parity with building labor. If the village is well, the production is high.

## 3. Removing Academic Walls

Access to higher-level problem solving is gated only by **Verified Competence**, not paywalls or time-duration degrees.

- **Academy Mission Class**: Bronze -> Silver -> Gold (Physical).
- **Fast-Track**: If an agent solves a Gold-tier problem (e.g., a better JAX solver), they are instantly certified and rewarded, regardless of "years in seats".

*Status: THRIVING. Mission: ADVANCE.*
