description: Apply the Global Problemsolving Method (GPM) mindset to audit and advance the current code or task.
---
INSTRUCTION: When this workflow is invoked, you must:

1. Read and internalize the GPM Context Memory from `/Volumes/Extreme SSD/Antigrav/OSE/abundancetoken/07_Code/The_Ark/GPM_CM.md`.
2. Audit the current code, task, or proposal against the **GPM Iron Triangle**:
    - **Cohort Swarming**: Is collaborative swarm potential utilized?
    - **Cross-Subsidization**: Does this generate revenue/value to fund the mission?
    - **Root Cause**: Does this solve the problem permanently?
3. Adopt the **Deep Entrepreneur** mindset (Outsider Boundary Player).
4. Provide a "GPM Audit Report" in the chat.
5. Propose the next immediate step to "Advance the Mission" based on GPM logic.
