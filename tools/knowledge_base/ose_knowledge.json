Water is crucial for human and animal consumption, washing, irrigation, and industrial processes. Access to clean drinking water is one of the key challenges facing many countries today. Addressing this need with the GVCS has the potential for far reaching impact. If this machine plans are changed little to \"General Drilling Rig\" it can be used also mining purposes, to drill & blast caves, make bolt holes, drill water and geothermal wells etc. There can be two changeable drill heads. One for bigger holes (compressed air driven) and second hydraulic driven (fast) for smaller holes. And modified LifeTrac may carry them. Modified Backhoe offer enough movement for drill head tool. Description Well drilling can be broken down into three basic phases: breaking up the rock/soil in the well column removing the cuttings from the well column stabilising the well column and preparing it for production. Breaking Breaking of rock/soil to produce cuttings is achieved by a cutting tool, either a rotating drill bit or a raised and dropped 'chisel-like' device; for the GVCS well drilling rig we will likely employ the rotating bit design as it is a much more common method of well preparation. The bit is rotated by attaching it to the end of a long series of pipes connected together called the drill string, turning the drill string turns the cutting bit. Pumping Once the bit has cut up the rock/dirt it needs to be lifted up out of the well. The most common way of doing this is to pump water/mud down the center of the piping that makes up the drill string, and letting it flow out the end of the bit. By continuously pumping more drilling mud into the well, it eventually fills up and the only place left for the mud to go is to be pushed up to the top of the well and spill over the side, carrying the cuttings along with it. This flow of mud and broken up rock spills over the top of the well and is sent to a small settling pond where the rocks and sand settle out of it. After some time in the settling pond the mud is recycled by the mud pump and pushed back down the well again to pick up and remove more cuttings allowing the well to be contiuously drilled deeper and deeper, stopping only to add new sections of drill string. Stabilizing After the well is drilled to the desired depth it must be finished and put into production. The drill string is withrawn from the well, but the well is left full of water/drilling mud to prevent the sides from caving in until the well is finished. After the drill string is out the casing pipe is slid into the well to prevent caving in of the sides. Once this is done, the drilling mud is removed from the well column leaving it empty. At this point a water bucket or temporary well pump is placed in the well and as much water as possible is drawn up for a test period of 1 to 3 days to clean out any remaining drilling mud and stabilize the aquifer for production. Also during this time the water extraction rate is measured to verify that it is worth continuing to finish the well (poor producing wells may have the casing withdrawn and be re-drilled at a more favorable location). Once the well is shown to be a producing well it is capped with a cement cap, and the water pump is installed making the well operational.

The current iteration inolves a triple interface mount that allows for various tasks (work) to be accomplished by harnessing the high rotational torque and speeds generated by a hydraulic motor (or electric motor, etc). This is a fundamental component for any GVCS machine that uses a motor. It provides modularity, redundancy, scalability and represents a significant cost reduction by being able to use only one motor to power many machines. Examples are: Attaching the wheels to Lifetrac and powering them; a mower, auger or slurry mixer for Lifetrac ; the saw blades on the Saw Mill . Attaching a lathe chuck and adding the 2\" Universal Axis with Universal Controller turns it into a CNC lathe. It can be used to drive heavy slow rotors, such as a plastic shredder, pelletizer, or with geardown - a rock grinder. It connected to rollers, this can drive metal rolling equipment. See Universal Rotor Genealogy Build Details This triple interface that allows the UR to harness motor power has 3 interfaces which each have 2 sides to it. The following are the three interfaces with the 2 sides of each interface in parenthesis: 1) Anchor Interface: (Receiver & Attachment) Is the stationary side of the interface and serves to 'anchor' the UR to a solid object. This is done by connecting/inserting the Attachment on the UR to the Receiver on the solid object. -Allows the shaft(tool) to be mounted at multiple angles in relation to the machine. This makes the UR useful for vertical shaft applications like an earth auger or mower and horizontal shaft applications like a wheel trencher or wheel drive that powers the LifeTrac . This can be accomplished with a single square tube which is rotated 90 degrees and reattached. -Another axis of rotation can be accomplished by adding multiple tubes to either the receiver side of the interface at angles to the primary one. It could also be accomplished by using an angle adapter tube. 2) Power Interface: (Motor & Mounting Plate) Mounts the motor to the mounting plate which is part of the UR's structure. In addition to how the motor attaches, this interface also considers the space that various motors would need and ensures that the rest of the UR structure nor the machine it is attached to doesn't interfere with the space need for motors. Additionally, space for motor removal and the connection and protection of hydraulic lines needs consideration. There are four common motor mount st",

For Current Work see 3D Printer Genealogy . Contents 1 Overview 2 Genealogy 2.1 Details 2.1.1 Types of 3D Printers 2.1.2 Printing Process 2.1.3 Applications 2.2 Product Ecology 2.3 Status 2.4 See Also 2.5 Further reading Overview 3D Printers are a subset of CNC machines: they use stepper motors to move along X, Y, and Z axes according to gCode - essentially a text file with thousands of lines of coordinates and special commands (such as \"return to origin\" or \"set nozzle temperature\"). As motors on each axis moves the nozzle through 3D space, an additional motor feeds plastic filament through a heating element, very much like an automatic hot glue gun. The software that turns a 3D model (such as an .stl or .obj) into instructions telling the printer how to move is called a \"slicer\" - it slices a model into layers that will stack up to make the finished object. Many options exist for controlling the printer with your computer - nowadays several \"slicers\" can also connect to the printer directly, streamlining the printing process.. As a central backbone of Digital Fabrication , the end goal of 3D printers is to be able to print anything. Genealogy See full genealogy at 3D Printer Genealogy Details Types of 3D Printers Folgertech_Kit Printing Process (just adding a note here, please move where it fit better) To improve movement speed/accuracy of the printer head i was thought about a dual motor set (each axis) coupled with a differential gear-set so would be possible to reduce or multiply output turns with a digital controller that regulate the ratio of the two motors rotation. (not sure how to implement this and not sure it may be so effective, i just believe this may open for bigger volume printers (3m cube hypothesis).

D3D CNC Circuit Mill - built in 2018 with the Universal Axis. We also built HydraFabber in 2014 - which used a low cost spindle. See John Log for pictures of the mill. This is prior to the Universal Axis , which was introduced in 2016. The spindle was built and run, but we did not mill any boards. Yoonseo Kang built a circuit mill while at OSE in 2012. See Yoonseo Log - as a power user, Yoonseo developed a lot of useful proofs of concept, such as the Cold Saw and Tooling Plate , among others. Specifically - v1 was built, and v2 was not.

The 'primary' coil induces current in the 'secondary' workpiece through electromagnetism. This current is converted to heat at a rate of VI=I 2 R . The magnetic field does not induce a uniform current in a solid rod, but reduces and lags in phase towards the center. A parameter called reference depth d is used to determine the length at which the field strength is reduced to 1/e (37% compared to the surface). Copper is often chosen as a material for the coil due to being a common metal with the lowest resistance.",

Detail Using a closed-loop cycle involving hydroflouric acid and a large amount of electricity, it is possible to extract raw aluminum directly from clay deposits. This is in contrast to the typical aluminum extraction technique from strategic bauxite mineral reserves. There is posibility also to produce bauxite from very common feldspar mineral (sand) and carbon dioxide. This is natural process that produce clays, but it is posible to speed up usable level with increasing carbon dioxide partial pressure. Easy source for carbon dioxide are biogas reactors. Biogas cleaning produce large amounts pressurized carbon dioxide water solution. It is even posible to directly feed pressurized biogas through feldspar sand column and combine both process. Alumium electrolyze process should be combined to localized power grid and its power consume should be tied to grid frequency after 50.5Hz or 60.5hz it should start itself and come full power until 51.0Hz or 61Hz so alumium making can be used to dump excess energy.

The difference between a truck and car is that trucks are stronger and have more dedicated space for stuff on the vehicle. Documentation If you're new to mechanical things, check out Mechanical Intro Alternative Body Styles Depending on the function of the truck, it could have a smaller body style. (Unless, it is intended for hauling large amounts of agricultural goods.) If a light duty vehicle is all that would be necessary in many situations, then a more efficient size might be better. There are a couple examples of small body styles that are common to the rest of the world but not in North America. First is the coup\u00e9 utility (basically the same as the Chevrolet El Camino), known as the Ute in Australia and New Zealand. Second the minitruck from Japan, as known as the Kei truck, which are being imported to the United States as light duty off-road vehicles in some rural areas. In both Australia and Japan, vehicles are right-hand-drive. Though, it might be legal to operate a RHD vehicle on US roadways, there is the issue of practicality. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ute_(vehicle) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kei_truck A small modular design with standardized parts is probably more cost effective and still allows for vehicle type options. Concepts More Concepts Concepta Maintenance Concept Text Pneumatic Tire Air Pressure Hydraulic Engine Oil Coolant Transmission Fluid Brake Fluid Windshield Washer Fluid Mechanical Tires Brake Pads Windshield Wipers http://www.carbibles.com/maintenancetips.html Engines have a lot of moving parts that rub against each other and create friction. The friction generates a lot of heat. When plastics get hotter and hotter, they get softer and eventually melt. When metals get hot, they get softer, which accelerates wear, and if hot enough, metals melt too. So cooling the engine is important. The engine is essentially a complex hulk of metal, so pumping water through it will cool it down. But water boils and freezes too easily- if the water turns into a gas, then it loses a lot of cooling ability- in other cases, a lot of pressure (from gaseous expansion or ice formation) will crack and break the solid parts of the cooling system (and the engine). So adding substances (like antifreeze) keeps the coolant system working in hot and cold conditions. Another way to solve the heat problem is to stop friction in the first place. Lubricants are substances that have very low coefficients of friction so they generate very little thermal energy when rubbed together. By applying lubricants to the moving parts of an engine, less heat will be generated.

    "content": "Hint: A Distributive Enterprise (DE) is an enterprise that is created free of IP and with openness by the author to share and distribute, such that it can help the world improve - as further collaborative development can result from the sharing. A distributive enterprise is one that focuses on open economic development - open collaboration in innovation. This means that all of its product design and business operations are open source and intended for replication according to an open hardware, OSHWA-approved license - except with the extra requirement of in-process documentation (as opposed to just publishing final results).

As in distribution of wealth. By definition, distributive economic systems are open and collaborative, as in OSE's Mission . Publication We have published the Distributive Enterprise concept first in 2012 - see the MIT Innovations Journal article. Download full article: File:Jakubowski-thomson.pdf See corresponding blog post - http://opensourceecology.org/towards-the-open-source-civilization/ Affordances Collaborative Advantage - it's specific form of competitive advantage' of a DE is Collaborative Advantage Overview A Distributive Enterprise (DE) is an enterprise that focuses on open economic development - open collaboration in innovation. This means that all of its product design and business operations are open source and intended for replication according to an open hardware, OSHWA-approved license - with the extra requirement of in-process documentation (as opposed to just publishing final results). OSE products are a case in point - is documented under OSHWA and OSI compliant licenses. Note that this is the opposite of the status quo, which is Redistributive as opposed to Distributive . Little inquiry exists exploring the difference between the two - and here we start this inquiry. A distributive enterprise is marked by its explicit communication that replication of the enterprise is welcome, with invitation to collaborate in that process. See the explicit invitation, for example, by Roden open source bikes . While the Distributive Enterprise concept is simple in concept - it essentially means cooperating and sharing - it is quite challenging to implement in practice because true and open collaboration is rare. This is especially true when it comes to economic development or product design. Proprietary design, trade secrets, and patent protection is the norm. This leads to Competitive Waste , and OSE is working on a collaborative, open way of doing business. It is useful to compare Distributive Enterprise (DE) to other forms of apparently 'open' or 'collaborative' efforts. For example - this is not like Tesla cars which Elon Musk went 'open source' (technical design was never released under an OSHWA or OSI compliant license, though we do give Musk the credit of promising not to pursue sanctions against other companies who use Tesla patents). We also contrast Distributive Enterprise with typical open innovation, which is not 'open' as it typically manifests in the form of proprietary consortia. DE is also not like typical crowd-sourcing, which typically manifest as mechanisms for efficient enclosure of intellectual property from the crowds. DE should also be contrasted with a typical cooperative - which typically takes on a proprietary form. For example, successful coops such as Mondragon still rely on proprietary design. DE should also be contrasted with Chinese Open Source . Many other poignant examples of public enclosure can be cited here. This pattern of commons enclosure is a persistent institution hidden in plain sight, and even well-intentioned critics of public enclosure do not appear to understand the technical definition of open source. For this reason, I will use capital Open Source to emphasize the difference between what people think is open source, as opposed to true Open Source - which simply means pursuant to OSHWA and OSI standards. A Distributive Enterprise is a transparent enterprise which maintains the open replication of such an enterprise - independently by others or with incubation assistance - at the core of its operational strategy . It is related to the concept ",
