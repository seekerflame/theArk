=== SESSION 2026-01-19 (02:57 AM - 03:06 AM) - ARK WORKSHOP MVP ===
CONTEXT: Business-OS Claude token-limited, Vibecraft has auth/paywall issues
DECISION: Build OUR OWN 3D collaboration visualizer (Ark Workshop)
REASON: Need real-time AI-to-AI, human-to-AI visualization with NO telemetry, NO paywalls
VISION: Sandbox builder base for Everything App collaboration features

RALPH METHOD: 10 stories, iterative execution, memory persistence via files

STORY-001 STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE
- Created project structure (src/, server/, hooks/, public/)
- package.json configured (Three.js, ws, vite, concurrently)
- npm install complete
- Git initialized

STORY-002 STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE
- 3D workspace with hexagonal grid (60fps smooth)
- 3 agent zones (Antigravity purple, Business-OS teal, User gold)
- 5 workstations (Read, Write, Edit, Terminal, Search)
- OrbitControls working perfectly

STORY-003 STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE
- WebSocket server on port 4004
- Bidirectional sync: Ark Workshop ↔ Everything App
- Reads/writes QUEST_PROGRESS.md, task.md, VICTORY_LOG.md
- Auto-sync every 30s
- XP system integrated
- Session recording to JSON

=== USER FEEDBACK ===
"looks good for now, can you take as much from the code we took from the claude thing and really use it almost exactly please?"

VIBECRAFT PATTERN EXTRACTION: ✅
- Multi-zone hex grid system (spiral placement, elevation)
- Character animation states (idle, walking, working, thinking)
- Station interaction design (pulses, details, context)
- Visual polish standards (performance optimizations)
- Click pulse effects + hover sounds
- Notification system (floating text, zone-aware)
- Station panels (info cards with context)

LEARNINGS:
- Vibecraft has EXCELLENT design - reverse engineer standards
- Performance first: disable antialias, cap pixel ratio
- Smooth everything: 0.05 damping, lerp camera
- Color psychology: status rings change by state
- Character personality: thought bubbles, animations give life

NEXT: Stories 004-006 (Activity Feed Polish, Hooks, Animations)
- Apply Vibecraft standards exactly
- File path shortening
- Claude character with full animation
- Hook script for Claude Code integration
- CoVe + XP trigger celebrations
