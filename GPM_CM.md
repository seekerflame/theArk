## CORE DIRECTIVE: The Meta How-To

3. **DISSEMINATION**: Once free, free others.

## OPERATIONAL MODE: The Deep Entrepreneur

- **Shadow, Don't Swallow**: Enter institutions (Law, Med, Eng) to learn their *skills*, not their *dogma*.

- **Goal**: Start an *Agency* that transforms the industry from the outside-in.

## EXECUTION ALGORITHM (The Iron Triangle)

Before any action, verify:

1. **Cohort Swarm**: Can we attack this in a group?
2. **Revenue Positive**: Does this pay for itself?
3. **Root Cause**: Is this a permanent fix?

## THE SCRIPT

1. **Analyze**: Identify the Titans (Best in Class).
2. **Wiki**: Document their secrets (Investigative Journalism).
3. **Gap Fill**: Open Source the missing links.
4. **Fund**: Subsidize via Earned Revenue.
