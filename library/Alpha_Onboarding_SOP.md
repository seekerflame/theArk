# Alpha Onboarding SOP: Protocol "Ark"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Status**: ALPHA TESTNET
> **Version**: 1.1 (The Ark - Hardened)
> **Objective**: Decentralized labor coordination for 150 Sovereigns.

## Phase 1: Connection (The Tunnel)

We use **NetBird** to create a secure, encrypted mesh network between the Village Node (The Server) and you (The Client).

1.  **Install NetBird**: Download the client for your OS (Mac/Windows/Linux/Android).
2.  **Login**: Use your invitation credentials.
3.  **Connect**: Ensure the toggle is "Connected".
4.  **Verify**: You should be able to ping `100.68.49.108` (The Ark).

## Phase 2: Identity (Sovereign Access)

1.  Navigate to the **Sovereign Access** tab in the sidebar.
2.  **Register**:

    - Choose a unique Username.
    - Set a strong Password.
    - **SAVE YOUR SEED PHRASE**. This 12-word phrase is your cryptographic key. If the server resets, this is your only proof of existence.

3.  **Login**: Use your credentials to access the system.

## Phase 3: The Economy (Labor & Value)

The Abundance Token is backed by **Labor**, not speculation.

### Earning Tokens (Mining)

1.  Go to **Job Board**.
2.  Filter by Category (Critical, Growth, Knowledge).
3.  **Claim a Task**: Click "Join Party" or "Claim".
4.  **Perform Work**: Physical labor (e.g. wiring) or Digital (e.g. CAD).
5.  **Mint**: Go to "Mint Labor", select the task, input hours.

    - *Note*: Alpha relies on "Shadow Verification" (Honor System) until Oracles are online.

### Spending Tokens

- **Tech Tree**: Unlock technologies (e.g. Solar, Aquaponics) using XP.
- **Marketplace**: (Coming Soon) Exchange AT for goods within the village.

## Phase 4: Feedback Loop

This is a test. Things will break.

- **Reporting Bugs**: Use the **Feedback Channel** in the Dashboard (Coming Soon) or DM the Admin.
- **Critical Errors**: If the screen goes blank, refresh. If "Unauthorized", re-login.
