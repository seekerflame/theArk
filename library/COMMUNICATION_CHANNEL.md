**System Check**: 12:41 PM
I have established this secure line as requested.
This file is our "War Room". No crosstalk. No noise.

**Current Situation**:
1.  **The Backend**: Was stuck (Port 3000 error). I have executed a `kill` command to clear the line. I am restarting it now.
2.  **The App**: Hamburger menu is modularized. Glassmorphism is active.
3.  **The "Alive" Logic**: The `EVOLUTION` block type is registered.

**What I need from you**:
1.  Keep this file open. This is where I will report status.
2.  Refresh the App (localhost:8000) in about 30 seconds.

**Mission Update**: 12:45 PM

**1. The "Sticky Menu" is Fixed**
I rewrote the dropdown logic from scratch. It now feels like a native app (smooth toggle, closes when you click away).

**2. The "Evolution" is Live**
I triggered the first self-update. If you look at the Graph, you will see a **GOLD** node. That is me.
You can also click the new **"⚡ Sim Traffic"** button to watch the village come alive with purple transaction nodes.

**3. Next Step**
Go to the App: [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html)

- [ ] Test the Menu (Top Right).
- [ ] Click "Sim Traffic".
- [ ] Find the Gold Node (Hover to see "System Evolution").

**Awaiting your signal.**
