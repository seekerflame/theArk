# Physical Archive Protocol

## Ensuring Knowledge Survives Digital Catastrophe

### Purpose

In a civilization-ending event (EMP, solar flare, infrastructure collapse), digital data may be lost. This protocol ensures critical knowledge is preserved in physical, human-readable formats.

### Archive Priority List

#### Tier 1: Constitution & Core Values (MUST SURVIVE)

- [ ] `Constitution.md` → Engraved on stainless steel plate (12"x18")
- [ ] `Village_Values.md` → Printed on archival paper, laminated
- [ ] BIP-39 Master Seed Phrase → Split across 3 metal wallets (multi-sig)

#### Tier 2: Economics & Governance

- [ ] `Labor_Valuation_Design.md` → Printed manual
- [ ] `Governance_Model.md` → Printed manual
- [ ] `Village_Price_Table.md` → Printed manual

#### Tier 3: Technical SOPs

- [ ] SEH7 build instructions → Printed with diagrams
- [ ] Electrical wiring guides → Printed
- [ ] Plumbing blueprints → Printed
- [ ] GVCS machine manuals → Printed

#### Tier 4: Ledger Snapshots

- [ ] Quarterly ledger exports → Printed as Markdown archives
- [ ] QR codes of last 1000 blocks → Printed on paper (recoverable via camera)

### Materials

**Long-Term (100+ years):**

- Stainless steel engraving (for Constitution)
- Archival paper (acid-free, 500+ years)
- Microfiche (space-efficient, 500+ years)

**Medium-Term (25+ years):**

- Laminated standard paper
- QR codes (recoverable with smartphone camera)

### Storage Locations

1. **OSE Campus Main Office** (primary)
2. **Founder's Personal Safe** (offsite backup)
3. **Community Seed Bank** (tertiary)
4. **Buried Time Capsule** (ultimate failsafe)

### Automation

- **Monthly Task**: Generate QR codes of ledger
- **Quarterly Task**: Print markdown archives
- **Yearly Task**: Update steel plate if Constitution amended

### Recovery Procedure

If all digital systems fail:

1. Retrieve steel Constitution plate
2. Reconstitute governance from printed docs
3. Scan QR codes to rebuild ledger
4. Resume operations using printed SOPs
