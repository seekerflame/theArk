# Future Builders Crash Course: Operations Manual (SOP)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Mission Goal**: Enable 1% of the global population to build their own homes by 2028 (approx. 10,000 events/year).
> **Current Status**: Pilot Phase. Focus is on transitioning from "Survival Mode" to a "Self-Sustaining, Replicable Product."

### 0. The Maslow Prime Directive

> [!CRITICAL]
> **No building occurs if biological needs (Heat, Food, Safety) are in critical deficit.**
> The Human Operations layer (Gaia) takes precedence over the Machine Operations layer (The Build). If the crew is cold or starving, the mission is failing.

## 1. Executive Summary & Financial Model

To scale to 10k events/year, each event must be cash-flow positive or neutral without relying on external subsidies.

### 1.1 Current Economics (Baseline)

- **Revenue**: ~$40,000 (20 participants @ ~$2k tuition)
- **Expenses**: ~$125,500
    - Infrastructure Improvements: $70,000 (One-time/CapEx)
    - Materials (House): $30,000
    - Food: $14,000
    - Tools: $5,000
    - Machine Rental: $4,000
    - Fuel/Electric: $2,500
- **Net Position**: **-$85,500 (Loss)**
- **Recovery Strategy**: Sale of finished house ($50k - $100k net revenue).

### 1.2 Target "Sustainable" Model

To achieve scalability, we must reduce variable costs and increase "Finish Velocity" to ensure the house sells.

- **Tuition Target**: Increase value proposition to justify higher tuition or more participants.
- **Food Efficiency**: Reduce $14k food bill via bulk prep and simpler, nutritious menus vs. ad-hoc catering.
- **Materials**: Partnerships/Sponsorships (e.g., Menards, local lumber) to drive down the $30k material cost.

## 2. Organization & Governance

A "hybrid" command structure is required to balance the intense focus needed for the build with the human needs of participants.

### 2.1 Roles

- **Build Commander (Marcin)**: Absolute authority on the house build. Focus: Velocity, Quality, Problem Solving.
- **Operations Manager (Specialized Role)**: Dedicated "Elite" role separate from the build.
    - Responsibilities: Food, Safety, Logistics, Morale, Site Cleanliness.
    - *Note: This prevents "burnout" where builders try to manage the kitchen.*
- **Assistant Teachers**: Specialized subject matter experts (SMEs) recruited for micro-topics (Electrical, Plumbing) to relieve the Build Commander.

### 2.2 The "Elite Team" Strategy

A small, specialized team splits time between the build and auxiliary support (Human Needs). This team ensures:

- The "Hab Lab" is warm and tidy.
- Food arrives on time.
- Participants feel safe and heard.

### 2.3 The Hearth Keeper (New Core Role)

See: [Hearth Keeper Protocol](./02_Hearth_Keeper_Protocol.md)
The "Operations Manager" role is evolved into the **Hearth Keeper**, a dedicated officer responsible for the "Biological Security" of the swarm. This is not a "nice to have" but a dependency for the build.

## 3. Site Management Protocols

### 3.1 Waste Stream Separation (Critical)

**Problem**: Burn barrels filled with co-mingled trash and recycling.
**Solution**: "Source Separation Station"

1.  **Infrastructure**: Deploy the 25 Coca-Cola drums immediately.
2.  **Labeling**: Paint/Tag drums clearly:

    - 🔴 **TRASH** (Landfill)
    - 🟢 **RECYCLE** (Aluminum/Glass/Plastic) - *Wash before tossing*
    - 🟤 **COMPOST** (Food Scraps Only)
    - 🔵 **BURNABLE** (Clean Wood/Paper Only - NO PLASTIC)

3.  **Desginated Zone**: Place stations at (1) Kitchen, (2) Build Site, (3) Dorms.
4.  **SOP**: Morning announcement reminder. Operations Manager checks bins daily at 2 PM.

### 3.2 Safety & Comfort (Anti-Cautionary Tale)

**Goal**: Eliminate "unsafe" perceptions that damage OSE's reputation.

- **Ventilation**: NO unventilated diesel heaters in enclosed spaces. Install proper exhaust kits or use electric heaters in the Hab Lab.
- **Hangar Roof**: Inspect and secure loose panels. If structure is dubious, cordon off zones until repaired.
- **Morale**: Daily "Stand-up" to address safety concerns publicly. If a participant feels unsafe, work stops in that zone until resolved.

## 4. Food Operations Manual

**Budget Target**: Reduce $14k spend.
**Current Mode**: Ad-hoc Catering (Expensive/Inefficient).
**Target Mode**: "Camp Kitchen" Bulk Prep.

### 4.1 Catering (Backup/Treats)

When cooking is not possible, use approved local vendors:

- **Mexican**: Señor Barrigas (Hamilton, MO) - *Taco Bar (Steak/Chicken/Beans)*.
- **Pizza**: Godfather's Pizza Express (Cameron, MO) - *Meat Lovers/Veggie*.
- **Chinese**: China Restaurant (Plattsburg, MO) - *Party Trays (Sesame Chicken/Beef & Broccoli)*.
- **Italian**: Fazoli's (St. Joseph, MO) - *Pasta Trays*.

### 4.2 In-House Efficiency Plan

1.  **Menu Planning**: Fixed rotational menu (Beans/Rice/Greens basics + Protein).
2.  **Bulk Purchasing**: Purchase staples from restaurant supply (Costco/Sam's) rather than local grocery for every meal.
3.  **Labor**: "Work Exchange" role specifically for a cook, or rotating teams of 2 participants per meal (prep/clean).

## 5. Event Operations & Logistics

### 5.1 Materials Logistics

- **Initial**: Manual runs to hardware stores (Lowes/Menards).
- **Target**: 100% Delivery to Site.
    - *SOP*: BOM (Bill of Materials) must be locked 2 weeks prior.
    - *SOP*: Order placed for delivery 3 days before start.
- **Inventory**: "Clerk of Works" checks delivery against BOM immediately. Missing items flagged instantly.

### 5.2 Teaching & Curriculum

- **Replicable Curriculum**: All lessons must be documented (Video/Wiki) so they can be taught by others in future locations.
- **Micro-Topics**: Break down complex skills (e.g., "Sweating Copper") into 15-minute operational modules.

## 6. Enterprise Development

To reach the 2028 Goal:

- **Documentation**: Every operational friction point (trash mixing, cold rooms, late food) must be documented in the Enterprise Spreadsheet.
- **Feedback Loop**: Post-event survey for participants. *Did you feel safe? Was the food good? Did you learn?*
- **Replication**: This manual is the "Source Code" for future Franchise/Chapter nodes.
