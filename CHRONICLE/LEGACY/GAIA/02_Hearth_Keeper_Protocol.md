# Gaia Protocol: Hearth Keeper

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Maslow Prime Directive**: No building occurs if biological needs (Heat, Food, Safety) are critical. The Hearth Keeper has the authority to halt non-essential build activities to resolve critical biological deficits.

## 1. Role Overview

**Role Name**: Hearth Keeper (The "Elaine" Role)
**Scope**: Responsibility for the biological and psychological "backend" of the civilization.
**Mandate**: To ensure that Builders are fed, warm, rested, and safe, enabling them to focus 100% on the build mission without "survival mode" tax.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

### 2.1 The Fire (Warmth)

- **Objective**: Maintain habitable temperatures in the Hab Lab (65°F-72°F).
- **Tasks**:
    - Monitor firewood levels.
    - Coordinate firewood procurement (delegating to Builders if necessary, but owning the outcome).
    - Ensure stove supervision during sleeping hours.
    - **Buffer**: Ensure 2 days of processed firewood is always on hand.

### 2.2 The Feast (Food)

- **Objective**: Provide high-protein, nutritious meals on a **Stone Schedule**.
- **Protocols**:
    - **Breakfast**: Hot & ready at 7:00 AM sharp.
    - **Lunch**: Ready at 12:00 PM.
    - **Dinner**: Ready at 6:00 PM.
    - **Snack/Leftover Station**: Maintain a pest-proof area with always-available calories (nuts, fruit, leftovers) for hungry builders.
- **Sourcing**:
    - Manage grocery runs (use Prius or optimized vehicle).
    - Maintain inventory of staples (rice, beans, salt, oil, coffee).

### 2.3 The Nest (Hab Lab Condition)

- **Objective**: A clean, organized, and calming environment for rest.
- **Tasks**:
    - Daily sweep/vacuum of common areas.
    - Bathroom sanitation check (daily).
    - "Clean Room" enforcement: No muddy boots past the mudroom.
    - Noise Level Management during Quiet Hours (10:00 PM - 7:00 AM).

### 2.4 The Shield (Logistics & Safety)

- **Objective**: Remove friction and anxiety.
- **Tasks**:
    - Coordinate airport pickups/shuttles.
    - Manage the "First Night Experience" (ensure new arrivals are welcomed, fed, and have a warm bed immediately).
    - Monitor stock of toiletries and first aid supplies.

## 3. Integration with Swarm Build

The Hearth Keeper is **NOT** a servant, but a **Mission Critical Officer**.

- **Daily Standup**: The Hearth Keeper reports status first ("Troops are fed and warm? Yes/No").
- **Veto Power**: The Hearth Keeper can flag "Red Status" (e.g., "We are out of food," "It is too cold") which triggers an immediate swarm response to fix the biological layer before resuming construction.
