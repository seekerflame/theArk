## 1. Elephants Identified

| Elephant | Category | Rating | Description |
|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Fake Focus** | Technical | 🔴 | Users sleeping/AFK while mining "Focus" tokens |
| **Social Silence** | Social | 🟡 | "Monk Mode" kills the community vibe |
| **Focus Farming** | Economic | 🔴 | Bot farms running 24/7 "Monk Modes" |
| **Artifact Spam** | Quality | 🟡 | Low-effort summaries to mint "Synthesis" tokens |
| **Exclusion** | Social | 🟡 | ADHD/Neurodivergent users penalized? |
| **Validation Cost** | Operational | 🔴 | Who validates the "Synthesis" documents? |
| **Tech Bypass** | Technical | 🔴 | Screen time API hacks / emulators |

## 2. Defense Matrix (10x per Elephant)

### 🔴 Fake Focus / Farming (The "Sleeping Monk")

*Risk: People just turn on "Monk Mode" and go to sleep or use multiple phones.*

1. **Prevention**: **Gyroscopic Liveness Check**. Device must detect subtle micro-movements (handling) or be strictly stationary (desk) but coupled with occasional "Check-ins".
2. **Prevention**: **Random Challenge**. Every 30-60 mins, a 5-second "Are you still focused?" prompt. Miss it = Burn session.
3. **Prevention**: **Cap per Day**. Max 2 hours of paid Focus per day (Humans have limits).
4. **Prevention**: **Bio-metrics** (Future). Apple Watch heart rate integration.
5. **Detection**: **Device Fingerprinting**. Detect emulators or factory reset phones.
6. **Detection**: **Impossible Hours**. Flag accounts focusing 24/7.
7. **Mitigation**: **Diminishing Returns**. Hour 1 = 1 AT. Hour 2 = 0.5 AT. Hour 3+ = 0.
8. **Recovery**: **Slashing**. If detected farming, burn all Focus-minted tokens.
9. **Antifragility**: **Social Staking**. You stake 10 AT to enter Focus Mode. You only get it back + reward if you complete it. (Loss Aversion).
10. **Antifragility**: **Group Focus**. "Co-working" sessions where peers verify each other via camera/presence.

### 🟡 Artifact Spam (The "ChatGPT Summary")

*Risk: People use AI to generate noise and mint "Synthesis" tokens.*

1. **Prevention**: **Input Cost**. Submitting a Synthesis requires burning 0.1 AT (anti-spam).
2. **Prevention**: **Verified Source**. Link the artifact to a specific timestamp/meeting in the ledger.
3. **Detection**: **AI Text Classifiers** (Irony: Use AI to catch AI).
4. **Detection**: **Pattern Matching**. Flag identical summaries across users.
5. **Mitigation**: **No Auto-Mint**. Synthesis requires **3 peer upvotes** to mint. (Triple Verification applied to content).
6. **Mitigation**: **Reader Rewards**. Tippers get a curation share (Incentivize honest rating).
7. **Recovery**: **Downvote = Burn**. If heavily downvoted, the minter loses reputation.
8. **Antifragility**: **Reputation Weight**. High-rep Scribes mint more valuable artifacts.
9. **Antifragility**: **Citation Graph**. If your artifact is cited by others, you earn royalties.

### 🔴 Exclusion / Accessibility

*Risk: Creating a "Neurotypical Supremacy" economy.*

1. **Prevention**: **Flexible Modes**. "Pomodoro" mode (25m) vs "Deep Work" (60m).
2. **Prevention**: **Active Focus**. Allow "Walking Mediation" (pedometer verification) for hyperactive types.
3. **Mitigation**: **Result-Based Alt**. If you can't sit still but produce code, mint via **Git Commit Verification** instead.
4. **Recovery**: **Accessibility Grants**. Community fund for those who struggle with the mechanism.
5. **Antifragility**: **Neuro-Diverse Metadata**. Tag artifacts with "ADHD Friendly" or "Deep Dive" structure.

## 3. Top 3 Critical Defenses (The "Must Builds")

1. **Social Staking (The Pact)**:
    * *Defends against*: Fake Focus / Flaking.
    * *Mechanism*: "I pledge 5 AT that I will focus for 60 mins." (Loss aversion is stronger than gain).

2. **Peer Verification for Artifacts**:
    * *Defends against*: Spam / AI Slop.
    * *Mechanism*: Nothing mints without 3 human witnesses. (Reusing `triple_verification.py`).

3. **Daily Focus Cap**:
    * *Defends against*: Bot Farming.
    * *Mechanism*: Hard limit. 1-2 hours paid focus/day per verified human.

## 4. Value Confirmation

**Does this align with "Attention is the Asset"?**
YES.
* We penalize distraction (Loss of Stake).
* We reward depth (Minting).
* We verify reality (Liveness / Peer Review).

**Status**: 🟢 **READY TO CODE** (Focus Mode timer + Staking logic).
