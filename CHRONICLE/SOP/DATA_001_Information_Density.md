# SOP: Bio-Information Density (DATA_001)

> [!NOTE]
> **Core Principle**: Data is only "Intelligence" if it fuels a metabolic loop (Food, Energy, Shelter). Otherwise, it is "Entropy".

## 🌲 Peeing on a Tree: Distributed Fertility

In the OSE Mesh, a soil sensor detecting a nitrogen spike from "peeing on a tree" is not pointless data. It is **Agro-Fertility Intelligence**.

- **Positive Outcome**: The system maps the "Distributed Fertilizer Loop". High nitrogen zones are prioritized for heavy-feeding crops (fruit trees).
- **The Swap**: You are exchanging biological waste for soil carbon. The sensor mints a small "Ag-Wealth" token fragment to the land-steward.

## 🚽 Peeing in a Toilet: Resource Capture

A sensor in a Biogas Digester or Compost Toilet measures **Potential Energy Yield**.

- **Positive Outcome**: The system calculates the methane output or compost readiness.
- **The Swap**: Concentrated input = Predictable energy. This data is critical for scaling a 150-person node's energy budget.

## 🛑 Entropy Detection (The Defense)

The system "defends" against improper placement by mapping sensor data against **Sacred Zones**.

| Action | Zone | Status | System Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tree Pee | Food Forest | ✅ WEALTH | Log N-Spike. Update Fertility Map. |
| Tree Pee | Well Head | ❌ ENTROPY | **Maslow Prime ALERT**. Risk of contamination. |
| Toilet | Hab Module | ✅ INTELLIGENCE | Track methane/compost yield. |
| Open Waste | Public Square | ❌ ENTROPY | Trigger "Nest Sweep" SOP for Hearth Keeper. |

## 💎 The Success Metric

If data or action leads to any of the following, it is **Intelligence**:

- **Temporal Yield**: +1% Life Liberty (Time saved from automated drudgery).
- **Metabolic Density**: +1% Caloric or Energy output.
- **Entropic Resistance**: -1% Maintenance friction or system complexity.

If data just fills a hard drive or consumes attention without a metabolic or sovereign output, it is **Digital Trash**.
