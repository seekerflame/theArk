# SOP: The Expansion Protocol (Onboarding)

**Goal**: Zero-friction onboarding for Friends and Local Businesses.
**Metric**: Time from "Hello" to "First Transaction" < 60 seconds.

---

## 1. THE "FRIEND" PROTOCOL (Personal)

**Context**: You are at a bar, park, or living room. You want to onboard a friend.

### Step 1: The Hook ("Quest Together")

* **Don't say**: "Join my decentralized crypto network."
* **Do say**: "I'm testing a game where we get paid to hang out. Scan this, I'll send you 5 tokens."

### Step 2: The Scan (Guest Mode)

1. Friend scans your **Personal QR** (from your Pip-Boy).
2. Opens `join.html` -> Taps "Guest Login" (No seed phrase yet).
3. **Action**: You send 5 AT to their visible wallet ID.
4. **Instant Dopamine**: Their phone vibrates. "Received 5 AT".

### Step 3: The First Quest (Co-Op)

1. Open **Party Quests**.
2. Select "Buy a round" or "Take a photo".
3. Add Friend (tap phones or select from nearby).
4. Complete task. Both earn 10 AT.

**Result**: They have 15 AT and a positive memory in <3 mins.

## 2. THE "MERCHANT" PROTOCOL (Business)

**Context**: You satisfy a small business owner (Rudy, Food Truck, Coffee Shop).

### Step 1: The Pitch ("Free Labor")

* **Don't say**: "Accept my token."
* **Do say**: "I have 50 local people who want to help you clean/organize/promote in exchange for store credit. No cash cost to you."

### Step 2: The Setup (Zero Friction)

1. Hand them the **"Merchant Starter Kit"** (Printed Flyer + 3 QR Stickers).
2. Stick **"Accepts Ark"** on the window.
3. Stick **"Quest Board"** QR near the register.

### Step 3: The First "Gig"

1. Ask: "What's one annoying task you hate doing?" (e.g., sweeping the patio, organizing condiments).
2. Create "Bounty": `Sweep Patio` = `50 AT` (Store Credit).
3. You (or a friend) do it immediately.
4. Pay with AT for a hot dog.

**Result**: They see labor -> value -> sales immediately.

## 3. THE PHYSICAL LOGISTICS (The Kit)

Every Ambassador carries a **"Seed Kit"**:

1. **5x QR Stickers**: Links to `join.html` (General entry).
2. **1x Demo Phone**: Loaded with Ark OS (Kiosk Mode).
3. **10x Business Cards**: "Good for 10 AT" (One-time claim code).

### Printing Instructions

- **QR Codes**: Use `./tools/generate_qr_codes.sh`
* **Flyers**: Use `web/assets/flyer_template.pdf`
* **Stickers**: Avery 2" Round Templates

## 4. TROUBLESHOOTING

* **"Is this crypto?"** -> "It's community service points, like a darker punch card."
* **"Is it legal?"** -> "It's a barter club. Private contract."
* **"I don't have a wallet."** -> "Guest mode creates one instantly."

*Advance the mission. Reduce friction. Gamify everything.*
