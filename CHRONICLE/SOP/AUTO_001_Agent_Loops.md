# SOP: AUTO_001 - Agent Loops & Autonomy

> [!CAUTION]
> **Primary Safety Boundary**: Agents are permitted to optimize **System Efficiency** but are strictly forbidden from altering **Biological Sovereignty Protocols** (e.g., Maslow Prime) without manual Oracle sign-off.

## 1. The Autonomous Loop (n8n & Parallel Compute)

To achieve a "Type 6" trajectory, the OS must self-improve even while the user is absent.

### 1.1 Architecture

- **The Controller (n8n)**: Use n8n to orchestrate complex logic flows between the Ark API, Mesh Federated nodes, and external "Sovereign Intelligence" (Agentic LLMs).
- **Parallel Execution**: Run a "Mirror Node" on a dedicated server. This node handles heavy compute (Ledger audits, Hardware telematics analysis) and pushes results to the local "Brainstem" node.
- **Auto-Prompting**: The system periodically triggers an "Agent Quest" (e.g., "Analyze last 24h soil data and update Agro-Wealth blocks").

## 2. Boundaries & Safety Resistors

To prevent "Digital Drift" or AI hallucinations from corrupting the ledger:

1.  **Verification Gate**: All agent-minted blocks are marked as `verified: False` by default. They require an Oracle (Human or High-Trust AI) to sign-off before they affect balances.
2.  **Resource Caps**: Autonomous loops are limited to 20% of system CPU/Memory to ensure local Life Support (The Ark) is always prioritized.
3.  **The "Kill Switch"**: A physical or top-level digital command that halts all `AUTO_001` flows immediately.

## 3. Self-Improvement Cycle (Recursive Optimization)

1.  **Observe**: Agent reads `ark_steward.log` and evolution stats via `/api/evolution`.
2.  **Analyze**: Agent compares current state against the **Sovereign Trio** (Temporal Yield, Metabolic Density, Entropic Resistance).
3.  **Propose**: Agent generates a `SYSTEM_UPGRADE` block suggesting a code or SOP change.
4.  **Execute**: After Oracle approval, the change is applied to the codebase.
