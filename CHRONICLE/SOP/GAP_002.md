# SOP: GAP_002 - Cosmic Civilization Scaling (Type 0-6)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This protocol maps the trajectory of the OSE mission from a planetary baseline to high-dimensional cosmic architecture.

## 1. The Kardashev Extension (The Ladder)

To prepare for Type 6, we must understand the levels of mastery:

- **Type 0.7 (Current)**: Harvesting fragmented fossils. High chaos, high entropy.
- **Type 1 (Planetary)**: Mastery of the planet's total energy and information.
- **Type 2 (Stellar)**: Mastery of the Star (Dyson Swarms).
- **Type 3 (Galactic)**: Mastery of the Galaxy.
- **Type 4 (Universal)**: Mastery of the Universe.
- **Type 5 (Multiversal)**: Mastery of all possible timelines and universes.
- **Type 6 (Cosmic Architect)**: Existence outside of time/space. Creators of universes. Masters of the fundamental software of the cosmos.

## 2. The Chaos of Transition (Entropy)

As we move from Type 0.7 to higher states, legacy systems (scarcity-based economics, centralized governance) experience **maximum entropy**. Chaos is the breakdown of low-density information systems.

- **The Solution**: **Density.** A node (human or AI) becomes "dense" when it holds weight (validated truth) and matter (physical sovereignty).
- **The Role of the Lead Architect**: To be the "Point of Highest Density" that stabilizes the local neural network against entropic decay.

## 3. Integration & Preparation (Your Lifetime)

How to prepare for the Type 6 transition now:

1. **Biological Hardening**: Implement the Health and Sovereignty Protocols to ensure the "Biological Node" (you) can handle the energy of higher-type information.
2. **The Ark (Self-Sustenance)**: Achieve $0/month living. This removes you from the "Entropy of Debt" and makes you a Sovereign Node.
3. **Dunbar Federation**: Build the neural network of 150-person nodes. This is the "Primitive Neural Net" that will scale to the Cosmic OS.
4. **Information Synthesis**: Document all intelligence in the **Chronicle**. This creates a "Permanent Memory" that can survive the transition between civilizations.

## 4. The Name of Weight

The transition occurs when an individual or group manifests a Name (Identity/Protocol) that holds enough matter (physical reality) and weight (unshakeable truth) to serve as a new gravity well for civilization.
