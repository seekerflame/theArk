# SOP: Economic Inversion Protocol (Labor Density)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Mission**: Invert the systemic devaluation of human labor by pegging the Abundance Token (AT) to historical High-Density purchasing power.
> **Standard**: The "Silver Standard" parity of 1960.

## 1. The Core Inversion

Modern fiat economies suffer from "Labor Dilution"—where an hour of work buys less every year. Ark OS implements "Labor Density," where the value of one AT is protected against inflationary theft.

- **Baseline**: 5 Silver Quarters = 1 Day of Labor (8 Hours).
- **Target Parity**: 1 AT = 0.625 Silver Quarters (Purchasing Power Equivalent).
- **Current Value Target**: ~$70 USD per AT (based on 2026 purchasing power parity for survival goods).

## 2. Implementation Rules

### 2.1 Decoupling from Fiat

The Ark does not care about the USD price of silver. It cares about what 5 silver quarters *bought* in 1960:

- A month's rent for a family home.
- A weekly grocery bill for a family of four.
- A full tank of fuel.

### 2.2 Inverted Pricing (Stone Schedule)

Internal OSE markets (Solar, Seeds, Shelter) MUST price their goods based on this density.

- **Example**: If a Seed Eco-Home (SEH) costs 1,000 AT, that price remains stable even if the USD price of materials doubles. The efficiency of production must increase to maintain this parity.

### 2.3 Housing Affordability Tracker (HAT)

Based on the **HOUSING AFFORDABILITY TRACKER (live).xlsx** data, the protocol targets a housing-cost-to-labor ratio of 1:4.

- **Goal**: A family home should cost no more than **2,000 AT** total (equivalent to ~250 days of labor), for **Sovereign Stewardship**.
- **Stewardship Title**: Once the construction cost (Labor + Materials in AT) is settled, the user holds a "Sovereign Title." There are no recurring "rent" or "lease" payments—only the shared cost of maintaining the Dunbar infrastructure (Roads, Power, Water).
- **Metric**: If local housing costs in fiat exceed this parity, the Ark must prioritize modular SEH deployment to stabilize the local Dunbar node.

### 2.4 The "Wealth Gap" Inversion

By maintaining high labor density, we ensure that a user working 40 hours a week earns enough "Store of Value" to survive and thrive, preventing the need for debt-based consumption.

- **Goal**: 145k/year (base 2026 USD equivalent) for a person working 40/hr weeks.

## 3. Monitoring & Governance

- **Oracles**: Must audit the "Purchasing Power Parity" (PPP) of AT monthly.
- **Treasury**: If the PPP drops (AT buys too little), the Treasury must tighten minting or increase OSE Store subsidies.

## 4. The Funding Engine (The Value Delta)

The "Funding" for the OSE mission does not come from venture capital or debt. It comes from the **Value Delta**:

- **Input Cost**: 1 Hour of Human Time (Rewarded with 1 AT = $70 Floor).
- **Physical Output**: OSE Tech + Permaculture + Nature's Compounding = ~$700+ in Physical Value.
- **The Treasury**: The $630 delta is "Captured Abundance," used to mint more machines, acquire more land, and onboard more people into the Ark.

## 5. Verification: Proof of Physics (The Global Guardrail)

To prevent "Value Inflation" (claiming value that doesn't exist), the Ark employs **Proof of Physics**:

1. **Local Witness**: Minting the "Value Delta" requires a multi-signature from the local **Dunbar Node (The Peers)**. You cannot claim to build a house alone in the dark.
2. **Multimodal Validation**: The Ark's GAIA core uses local sensor data (Vision Analyzer, GPS, Hardware Bridge) to verify that physical materials were moved and transformed.
3. **Audit Trait**: Every AT minted for the Value Delta is linked to a physical artifact (an SEH, a solar array, a harvest).

## 6. Proof of Physics (PoP) Verification

To prevent "Value Inflation" and ensure the AT is backed by the real physical universe, we use a **First Principles** Hardware-Software Interlock.

### 6.1 First Principles (Force x Distance)

Verification is stripped of digital complexity. We measure **Physical Work**:

- **Baseline**: 10 kWh (36 Megajoules) of useful work output = 1 AT Floor ($70).
- **Transformation**: Did mass move? Was energy converted?
- **Sensors**: Direct pulse from solar charge controllers, CEB hydraulic pressure, or agricultural robotic vision.

### 6.2 The Mesh Guardrail

Verification requires a **Triple Interlock**:

1. **IoT Pulse**: Secure hardware element signature for the physical event.
2. **Peer Consensus**: 3 signatures from the local 150 (Dunbar Node).
3. **Ledger Integrity**: Append-only "Receipt of Reality."

## 7. Permanence: Physical & Digital

We do not build to "sell." We build to **last**.

### 7.1 Physical Permanence

- **Nature's Design**: Houses that breathe, grow, and strengthen with age (Hearth-centered).
- **Material Sovereignty**: Using CEB (Compressed Earth Blocks) and local timber, we build structures that last 500+ years, inverting the 30-year "shit-build" cycle.
- **Genetic Wealth**: Permaculture creates food systems that become more productive with ZERO labor over time. This is the ultimate inversion of the grocery store supply chain.

### 7.2 Digital Permanence

- **Protocol > Platform**: No centralized dependencies. The Ark runs on local hardware, synced via NetBird/P2P.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Your data is stored in "Cold/Hot" local tiers, designed to be readable in 500 years without "Bit Rot" or cloud bankruptcy.
- **Eternal Logic**: The Code Justice core ensures that the rules of the economy are as permanent as the foundations of the SEH.

## 8. The Value Hierarchy (Proof of Effort)

Not all 1 AT rewards are equal in fiat terms. To prevent inflation and ensure feasibility, the system distinguishes between **Attention** and **Physics**.

### 8.1 Attention Bounties (The Hook)

- **Activity**: Reviews, Scrolling, Watching Ads, Basic UI interactions.
- **Multiplier**: **0.1x - 0.5x**.
- **Logic**: These tasks are subsidized by external fiat marketing budgets. They earn "Soft AT" which is high-utility for small purchases (Dagny's coffee) but cannot be burned to mint "High-Density" assets without ascending the tech tree.

### 8.2 Human Capital (The Service)

- **Activity**: Code, Design, Detailing, Specialized Services.
- **Multiplier**: **1.0x** ($70/hr Floor).
- **Logic**: Backed by **Human Expertise** and verified via Code Justice / Peer Review.

### 8.3 Sovereign Production (The Physics)

- **Activity**: Construction, Agriculture, Energy, Material Transformation.
- **Multiplier**: **1.0x Floor + Abundance Multiplier (10x)**.
- **Logic**: Backed by **Proof of Physics**. This generates the "Value Delta" (Funding) used for global mission expansion.

## 9. The Founders Move (Organic Growth)

To ensure the federation expands organically and securely, we utilize **Proof of Referral**.

- **Founders Multiplier**: 1.5x AT boost for all labor during the active campaign.
- **Condition**: Onboard a new sovereign node (150 people cap) that passes the first 30 days of Dunbar consensus.
- **Strategy**: This captures the value normally lost to centralized marketing systems and redistributes it to the pioneers building the mesh.
