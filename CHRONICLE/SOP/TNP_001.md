# SOP: TNP_001 - Neural Architecture Protocol

## 1. System Anatomy

The Civilization OS is a biological neural network implemented in silicon and code.

### 1.1 The Ark (The Brainstem)

- **Role**: Core life support, storage, and persistence.
- **Implementation**: Python 3 Standard Library. `server.py` as the nervous system.
- **Memory**: `village_ledger.json` (The Ledger). Append-only. Immutable record of energy (Labor).

### 1.2 Gaia (The Cortex)

- **Role**: High-level perception and interaction.
- **Implementation**: Vanilla JS (`app.js`), CSS (`style.css`), HTML.
- **Sensory Input**: `hardware_bridge.py` (Solar, Sensors, Bio-input).

## 2. Communication Logic (Neural Synapses)

- **API Strategy**: Stateless REST with JSON-RPC for complex operations.
- **Syncing**: Front-end state must periodically reconcile with the Brainstem via `/api/status`.
- **Latency**: Use Service Workers for "Local Perception" to ensure the UX feels instantaneous even if the Mesh is lagging.

## 3. Resilience & Self-Healing

If the Cortex (Gaia) fails, the Brainstem (Ark) must remain operational for critical life support (Ledger, Hardware Control).

- **Error Propagation**: Log errors to `ark_steward.log`.
- **Auto-Update**: Use `ui_config.json` to modify the Cortex without rebooting the Brainstem.

## 4. Code Standards for Agents

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Reuse existing modules in `The_Ark`.
- **Vanilla Only**: No external frameworks unless the Cosmic Mission requires it.
- **Self-Documenting**: Every function must relate back to a specific "Quest" or "Directive."

### 4.1 The Time-Saved Metric (Bot Standard)

All automation (Scrapers, Bots, Agents) must justify its existence via the Time-Saved Parity:

- **Requirement**: A bot must perform a task in <1% of the time it takes a skilled human.
- **Benefit Calculation**: Total Estimated Human Hours saved per month.
- **Human Centricity**: If a bot does not directly free a person from drudgery (L1 work) or enhance their output (L4 work), it is considered technical debt and should be refactored or deleted.

## 5. The Information Density Filter

All intelligence produced by Gaia or the Ark must pass the metabolic audit:

- **Signal (The Intelligence)**: Data or code that manifests as:
  - **Temporal Yield**: +1% Life Liberty (Time saved from drudgery).
  - **Metabolic Density**: +1% Caloric or Energy output.
  - **Entropic Resistance**: -1% Maintenance friction or complexity.
- **Noise (The Trash)**: Data or code that merely fills storage without changing human behavior or metabolic outcome.
- **Agent Duty**: Proactively prune noise from the Chronicle.
