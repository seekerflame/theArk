# SOP: PSY_001 - Psychological Sovereignty

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Core Principle**: Technology must serve the human nervous system, not the other way around. If the app induces "Digital Anxiety" or "Time Scarcity," it is an entropic failure.

## 1. The Time Wealth Framework

Legacy systems (social media, fiat banking) are designed for **Time Extraction**. OSE is designed for **Time Reclamation**.

### 1.1 From Drudgery to Presence

- **The Problem**: Constant notification pings and infinite scrolling create a state of high-cortisol "survival mode."
- **The Solution**: UI/UX must be designed for "Stone Schedule" focus. Use psychological anchoring to ground the user in their physical environment.
- **Actionable UI**:
    - No infinite scrolls.
    - Information is revealed only when relevant to a specific "Quest."
    - Visual rewards for **Temporal Yield** (Showing "Life Liberty Earned" in minutes/hours).

### 1.2 The "Time Movie" Display

- **Life Expectancy Baseline**: The UI displays a countdown of "Estimated Seconds Remaining" based on actuarial averages.
- **The Contrast**: Juxtapose this against **Time Wealth** (AT earned). It makes the liberation of time visceral: "You have regained 4 hours of your life today."
- **Sleep Tracking**: Integration with sleep logs to visualize "Active Life" vs. "Recovery Life," moving from a biological baseline to sovereign performance.

## 2. Unconscious Reality Crystallization

If reality is crystallized by what we believe to be true unconsciously, then we must curate a belief system based on **Abundance** rather than **Scarcity**.

### 2.1 Pattern Interrupts

When the system detects a user engaging in low-signal "Digital Trash" behavior (e.g., refreshing stats excessively), trigger a **Pattern Interrupt**:

- **The "Breathe" Prompt**: A momentary 5-second pause screen with a grounding visual.
- **The "Look Up" Command**: A suggestion to check a physical sensor or perform a physical community task.

### 2.2 Abundance Anchoring

- **Sovereign Wallet**: Every time a user opens their wallet, the UI displays a "Wealth of Time" metric alongside their AT balance.
- **Mesh Map**: Visualizing the federation as a living, biological rhizome to reinforce the feeling of being part of a larger, resilient organism.

## 4. Privacy Gates & Data Hardening

To prevent "Digital Surveillance" and data leakage, we implement a bi-layer ledger system.

### 4.1 Personal Inventory (Private Ledger)

- **Sovereign Inventory**: Skills, medical biostats, and personal habits are stored on the **User's Local Node ONLY**.
- **Privacy Gate**: Users explicitly select which data points move to the **Public Ledger** (e.g., skill tags for quests) versus staying in their **Private Sanctuary**.

### 4.2 Localized Intelligence

- **Private LLMs**: Users can train/fine-tune local LLMs on their personal data for consciousness raising and self-improvement without a single packet leaving their local hardware.

## 3. The "Hearth Keeper" Psychology

The community role of **Hearth Keeper** isn't just about food; it's about **Morale and Psychological Safety**.

- **The 150-Person Limit**: Respect Dunbar's number to ensure every node member feels "seen" and "valued."
- **Conflict Resolution**: Use "High-Signal Feedback" (FBCC) to resolve tensions before they become entropic.
