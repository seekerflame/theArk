# File Cleanup & Validation Protocol

## Purpose

Ensure every file in the OSE project is **actively advancing the mission**. Dead files create entropy.

---

## Validation Criteria

For each file, ask:

1. **Is it referenced?** Does something else link to or use this file?
2. **Is it current?** Has it been updated in the last 30 days?
3. **Is it actionable?** Does it contain instructions someone can execute?
4. **Is it unique?** Is there another file doing the same thing?

**If NO to all → Archive or Delete**

## Directory Audit Checklist

### `/Volumes/Extreme SSD/Antigrav/OSE/`

| Directory | Action |
|:---|:---|
| `CHRONICLE/` | ✅ KEEP - Active documentation hub |
| `abundancetoken/` | ⚠️ AUDIT - Large, may have dead files |
| `furnace/` | ❓ CHECK - Only 3 files, confirm purpose |
| `INTERANTICOMS/` | ❓ CHECK - 13 files, may be legacy |
| `MASTER_PROMPT.md` | ✅ KEEP - Agent bootloader |

### `/abundancetoken/07_Code/The_Ark/`

| Pattern | Action |
|:---|:---|
| `village_ledger_backup_*.json` | 🗑️ ARCHIVE - Too many backups, keep only last 5 |
| `server_v*.log` | 🗑️ DELETE - Old version logs |
| `*.log` files > 1MB | 🗑️ TRUNCATE - Keep last 1000 lines |

---

## Automated Cleanup Script (TODO)

```bash

#!/bin/bash

# cleanup_dead_files.sh

# Remove old backup ledgers (keep last 5)

ls -t village_ledger_backup_*.json | tail -n +6 | xargs rm -f

# Truncate large logs

find . -name "*.log" -size +1M -exec sh -c 'tail -1000 "$1" > "$1.tmp" && mv "$1.tmp" "$1"' _ {} \;

# List unreferenced markdown files

# (Manual review required)

```

## When to Run

- **Before major sessions**: Clean dead weight
- **After major sessions**: Archive completed work
- **Weekly**: General hygiene check

*Protocol: ACTIVE*
