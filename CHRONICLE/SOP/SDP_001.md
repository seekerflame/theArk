# SOP: SDP_001 - Sovereign Documentation Protocol

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Adherence to this protocol is MANDATORY.** Failure to document according to these rules results in technical debt that degrades the project's serviceability for future agents.

## 1. The Core Principle: "Low Noise, High Signal"

Every session must leave the "territory" in a more readable state than it was found.

## 2. Mandatory Session Artifacts

Every agent session must result in two types of documentation in the `CHRONICLE`:

1. **Session Log**: A summary of actions taken, including successes and failures.
2. **State Update**: Any changes to protocols or technical specs in the `CHRONICLE` or root documentation.

## 3. Directory & File Naming

- **Session Logs**: `CHRONICLE/SESSION_LOGS/YYYYMMDD_SESSION_ID.md`
- **Protocol IDs**: Start with `SDP_` for Sovereign Documentation Protocols, `GAP_` for Gaia Protocols, `TNP_` for Technical Protocols.

## 4. Format Requirements

- **Alerts**: Use GitHub-style alerts (`[!NOTE]`, `[!IMPORTANT]`, `[!CRITICAL]`) for mission-critical context.
- **Links**: ALWAYS use absolute paths with `file:///` URIs to ensure clickable navigation across the Extreme SSD.
- **Code**: Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers.

## 5. The "Snapshot" Rule

Before concluding a session, the agent MUST run the `CHRONICLE/scripts/snapshot.sh` script to commit changes to the project's version control with a clear summary.
