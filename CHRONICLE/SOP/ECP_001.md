# SOP: ECP_001 - Universal Mobility & Federation Protocol

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This protocol defines how the Civilization OS scales from a single "Village Node" to a global "Neural Network."

## 1. The Dunbar Constraint (Node Sizing)

Human cognitive limits dictate the maximum size of a coherent social unit.

- **Node Limit**: **150 individuals (Dunbar's Number).**
- **Rationale**: Beyond 150, trust-based verification breaks down and requires bureaucracy (the virus).
- **Scaling Method**: Once a node reaches 150, a "Mitosis" event occurs: a new "Seed Node" is established at a new location.

## 2. The Federation Protocol (The Mesh)

Nodes do not compete; they federate into a Global Mesh.

- **Synchronization**: Nodes share the `village_ledger.json` across NetBird P2P tunnels.
- **Verification**: Cross-node Oracles verify "External Quests" to ensure token integrity.
- **Resource Sharing**: If Node A has surplus (e.g., Solar) and Node B has deficit, tokens catalyze the physical logistics of transfer.

## 3. Universal Mobility (Passporting)

Earned Abundance Tokens (AT) are the "Common Currency of Survival" across the Federation.

- **Travel Protocol**: A member of Node A can spend AT to "purchase" transit and accommodation in Node B.
- **The Calculation**:
    - `Transit_Cost` = (Logistics_Energy + Admin_Verification)
    - `Stay_Cost` = (Daily_Calric_Input + Habitat_Maintenance)
- **Sovereign Landing**: Upon arrival at a federated node, the member is granted temporary status and basic needs, provided their AT balance is sufficient or they commit to new "Quests" at the destination.

## 4. Distribution Strategy

"Getting it into everyone's hands."

1. **The PWA**: Installable via browser, works offline via Service Workers.
2. **The Hard Drive**: Distributed via SSD (e.g., Extreme SSD) for air-gapped sovereignty.
3. **The Mesh**: Propagated via LoRa and Mesh VPN tunnels.
