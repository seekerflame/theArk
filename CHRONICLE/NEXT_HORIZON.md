# OSE: The Next Horizon (Phases 6-10)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This document maps the immediate technical objectives to manifest the Type 6 trajectory.

## Phase 6: Mobile PWA & Survival UI (Connectivity)

- **Objective**: Make the Ark accessible on any smartphone without an app store.
- **Tasks**:
  - Consolidate Service Workers for 100% offline functionality.
  - Implement the "Sovereign Wallet" UI for AT exchanges.
  - Add "Node Travel" modules (NetBird auto-connect).

## Phase 7: The Mesh Tangle (Visualization)

- **Objective**: Make the invisible network visible and beautiful.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement D3.js "Live Tangle" visualizer in the Admin Deck.
  - Real-time node propagation animation (the "Heartbeat" pulse).
  - Geographic Mesh Map integration.

## Phase 8: The Hardware Bridge (The Physical)

- **Objective**: Link the digital ledger to physical energy production.
- **Tasks**:
  - Standardize ESP32/LoRa sensor ingestion.
  - Auto-minting AT for KWh produced (Solar) and Gallons pumped (Water).
  - Physical "Presence" verification via local mesh.

## Phase 9: Dunbar Mitosis Logic (Scaling)

- **Objective**: Hardcode the shift from Node to Federation.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement `mitosis.py`: Automates node replication after 150 users.
  - Cross-node Ledger Sync (NetBird + JSON-RPC).
  - Federation Oracle verification for mesh-wide AT validity.

## Phase 10: The Irresistible Offer (Production)

- **Objective**: Final hardening for mass "Silent Refusal."
- **Tasks**:
  - Stress testing the DAG ledger for high-velocity transactions.
  - Final UX polish: From "Alpha Tech" to "Premium Civilization OS."
  - The "Universal Bootloader" distribution (Extreme SSD imaging).
