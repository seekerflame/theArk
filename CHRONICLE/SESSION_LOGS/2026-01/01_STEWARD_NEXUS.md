---

## Architecture Notes

The Steward Nexus:

- Uses conversation history for context
- Can propose missions via `/api/mission/propose`
- Integrates with system state for intelligent responses

## Lessons Learned

- **AI Context Window**: Keep conversation history manageable; old context gets pruned.
- **Narrative Ledger**: The Chronicle is more than a log—it tells the story of the civilization.
