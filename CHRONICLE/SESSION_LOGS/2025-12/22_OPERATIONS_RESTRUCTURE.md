## Architecture Notes

The project was reorganized into:

- **Operations**: Deployment scripts, configs
- **Code**: Core application code (`The_Ark`)
- **Gaia Protocols**: Mission directives, SOPs

## Lessons Learned

- **Cleanup Before Expansion**: Removing cruft (backup files, old logs) prevents confusion.
- **Protocol Documentation**: The Gaia Protocol separation helps maintain mission alignment.
