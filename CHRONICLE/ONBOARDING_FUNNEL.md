# OSE Onboarding: Start Building Your Reality

Welcome to the **Civilization OS**. We are not a university, a hobbyist group, or a political movement. We are a decentralized production network building the foundations of a Type 1 Civilization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Irresistible Offer**: Stop working for debt. Start working for wealth. We provide the tools, the knowledge, and the economic engine to achieve $0/month cost of living through sovereign production.

## Choose Your Path

We operate in cycles of **Competence**. Choose the level of autonomy that fits your energy:

### Level 1: The Builder (Competence)

*Duration: 6-Week FBCC Sprints*

- **Outcome**: Learn to frame, weld, and plumb the **Seed Eco-Home**.
- **Deliverable**: A functional survival shelter module.
- **Reward**: Immediate practical capability + 500 AT (Abundance Tokens).

## The Economy of Abundance

Every hour of your labor is worth 1 **Abundance Token (AT)**. Unlike fiat, AT is backed by the physical production capacity of the OSE Mesh.

## The Vision

We are transitioning from a Type 0 to a **Type 1 Civilization**. This requiresInformation Density (The Ark) merged with Energy Density (The GVCS).

**The old world is entropic. The new world is abundant. Choose wisely.**
