# Abundance Token (AT): Value vs. Utility

> "The failure of most economies is the confusion of price for value. In Ark OS, we optimize for Truth."

## 1. The Core Value (The "What")

The **Value** of the Abundance Token is absolute and unchanging.

- **Formula**: `1 AT = 1 Hour of Validated Human Labor`.
- **Backing**: The token is backed by the finite energy of human time applied to the mission (Bio-Energy).
- **Hardness**: Unlike fiat, AT cannot be "printed" by a central bank. It is ONLY minted when labor is verified by the Triple Verification Protocol.
- **Purpose**: To provide a stable unit of account for the transition from scarcity to abundance.

## 2. The Network Utility (The "How")

Moving from Value (Backing) to **Utility** (Usage). This is how the token interacts with the world.

### A. Focus Economy (Monk Mode)

- **Utility**: Verifying the *input* of attention as a form of labor.
- **Reward**: AT is minted because *Focused Attention* is the prerequisite for all High-Quality Labor.

### B. Governance (Justice Hub)

- **Utility**: Reporting and Staking.
- **Mechanism**: AT is used as "Skin in the Game". Reporters stake AT to file claims. Valid claims refund the stake; invalid claims (spam) burn it.

### C. Resource Access (Barter/Market)

- **Utility**: Exchanging AT for physical goods (Solar Power, Food, Hab modules).
- **Mechanism**: The **OSE Store** accepts AT at a parity determined by the "Cost of Living" index (Stone Schedule).

### D. Service Bounties (Quest Board)

- **Utility**: Delegation.
- **Mechanism**: Users pay AT to have others perform specific tasks (fixing code, building walls).

## 3. The Clear Separation

| Category | Value (Backing) | Utility (Usage) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Origin** | Verifiable Labor / Focus | The Mesh Network |
| **Goal** | Preservation of Human Time | Efficient Resource Exchange |
| **Inflation** | Impossible (Matches actual labor) | High Velocity (Frequent spending) |
| **Philosophical Pole** | The Temple (Sacred Time) | The Factory (Efficient Output) |

## 4. Why this matters

To onboard 1,000+ users, we must be clear:
**You aren't "buying" a coin. You are "pre-paying" for human labor or "earning" credit for your own time.**

If a user asks: "What is AT worth?", the answer is simple:
**"One hour of your life, or one hour of ours."**
