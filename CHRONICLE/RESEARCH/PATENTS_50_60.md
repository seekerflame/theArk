# Research: Modular Industrial Patents (1950s-1960s)

> [!NOTE]
> This document synthesizes key modular design principles from mid-20th century patents to inform the construction of the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS).

## Key Patents Identified

### 1. US 2,604,176A: Tractor Frame Structure (1952)

- **Principle**: Exploded modular frame for track-type tractors.
- **Modularity**: Separation of the power-transmitting device from the track frame.
- **GVCS Application**: Modular power units that can be swapped between track and wheel configurations.

### 2. US 2,510,486: Garden Tractor (1950)

- **Principle**: Interchangeable tools and simplified repair path.
- **Modularity**: Quick-connect tool couplings.
- **GVCS Application**: Standardized hitch and PTO (Power Take-Off) interfaces for LifeTrac attachments.

### 3. US 2,987,129: Modular Tractor Design (1961)

- **Principle**: Final drive assembly as a "ready interchangeable modular type".
- **Modularity**: Self-contained transmission and drive blocks.
- **GVCS Application**: Hydraulic motor/wheel modules that can be replaced in minutes.

### 4. US 3,212,588: Modular Agricultural Vehicle (1965)

- **Principle**: Universal chassis with swappable engine and operator cabs.
- **Modularity**: Separation of "Power" from "Task".
- **GVCS Application**: The "Micro-Car" and "Heavy Utility" crossover modules.
