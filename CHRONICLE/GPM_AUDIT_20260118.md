# 📊 GPM AUDIT REPORT: Pip-Boy & Sovereignty Stack (2026-01-18)

## Iron Triangle Analysis

### 1. ✅ Cohort Swarming: CAN WE ATTACK THIS IN A GROUP?

**Current State**: PARTIAL (60%)

**What's Working**:

- OSE collaboration initiated (Marcin contacted about governance)
- Liz collaboration prep (first contact message ready)
- Open-source design (enables community contribution)
- Village pilot model (10-50 people using together)

**What's Missing**:

- No active team yet (solo execution bottleneck)
- No hackerspace partnership (need OSE machine access)
- No co-builders recruited (knowledge transfer needed)
- Community engagement = 0 (GitHub repo not promoted)

**GPM Prescription**:

- **Recruit 2-3 Co-Builders** from OSE community or local hackerspace (50% rule: they do 50% work, gain 100% insight)
- **Assembly Parties**: Make first 10 units together, not alone
- **Skill Transfer**: Teach PCB design, firmware, enclosure CAD (disseminate = free others)
- **Leverage Institutions**: Use university engineering labs (shadow don't swallow)

**Score**: 6/10 (potential high, execution low)

---

### 2. ⚠️ Revenue Positive: DOES THIS PAY FOR ITSELF?

**Current State**: NOT YET (0%)

**Revenue Model Gaps**:

- No pricing finalized ($70 retail? $100 crowdfund? $50 DIY kit?)
- No presales (zero revenue, all cost)
- No grant applications (OSE partnership could fund)
- First dollar not earned (Rudy Raid not executed)

**Cost Reality**:

- 100-unit batch: $4,500 upfront
- Time investment: ~100 hours design + 16 hours/unit build
- OSE machines: $4,000+ (Fab Station required)

**GPM Prescription**:

- **Cross-Subsidy Model**:
  - Day Job = Sell Pip-Boys at $100/unit (covers cost + time)
  - Revolution = Give away designs (open source, enable replication)
- **Crowdfunding**: Presell 50 units at $100 = $5,000 (funds bulk order + first OSE machine)
- **Grant Strategy**: Apply to solarpunk/OSE foundations (sell vision, not product)
- **Service Revenue**: Offer workshops ($50/person, teach how to build)

**Critical Path**: MUST generate first dollar before scaling

**Score**: 2/10 (revenue model missing, high risk)

---

### 3. ✅ Root Cause: IS THIS A PERMANENT FIX?

**Current State**: STRONG (85%)

**What Makes This Root Cause**:

- **Tackles Dependency**: Off-grid communication (no telecom needed)
- **Enables Fabrication**: OSE machines + blueprints = local production
- **Sovereign Technology**: No cloud, no subscriptions, user owns device
- **Scalable Pattern**: 9-device stack = complete village sovereignty
- **Anti-Fragile Design**: Modular, upgradeable, repairable (designed for eternity)

**What's NOT Root Cause Yet**:

- Still depends on AliExpress/Mouser for chips (supply chain risk)
- Firmware complexity (Arduino ecosystem, not from-scratch)
- E-ink displays (single supplier: Waveshare)

**GPM Prescription**:

- **V2.0**: Transition to RISC-V open chips (no vendor lock-in)
- **V3.0**: OSE silicon fab (make chips locally, ultimate root cause)
- **Accept Pragmatism**: Use Arduino now, rewrite firmware later (ship v1.0 first)

**Score**: 8.5/10 (strong root cause, minor dependencies)

---

## 🎯 GPM COMPOSITE SCORE: 5.5/10

**Analysis**:

- **Cohort Swarm**: 60% (potential, needs execution)
- **Revenue Positive**: 20% (critical gap, blocks scale)
- **Root Cause**: 85% (strong foundation)

**Bottleneck**: Revenue model missing. Without first dollar, cannot fund bulk order, cannot build OSE machines, cannot scale.

---

## 🚨 THE DEEP ENTREPRENEUR AUDIT

### Shadow vs Swallow Check

**Current Approach**: ✅ SHADOW

- Learning from OSE (using their machines, not competing)
- Learning from Liz (integrating her platform, not forking)
- Learning from Meta neural tech (EMG, not their business model)
- Open-sourcing learnings (free others, GPM dissemination)

**Risk**: Swallowing AliExpress model (dependent on their chips)
**Fix**: Transition to salvage + OSE fab over time

---

### The 50% Rule Application

**Where Applied**:

- Liz: We provide hardware (50%), she provides software (50%), together = full stack
- OSE: We provide coordination layer (50%), they provide fab machines (50%), together = decentralized manufacturing
- Village: We provide devices (50%), they provide use cases + feedback (50%), together = sovereignty

**Where Missing**:

- No co-builders recruited yet (doing 100% of work alone)
- No hackerspace partnership (paying 100% of costs)

**Fix**: Find 2-3 collaborators this week (split work, split insight)

---

## 📋 GPM-ALIGNED ACTION PLAN

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Cohort Swarm**:
   - Email Liz (collaboration = cohort)
   - Contact local hackerspace (recruit co-builders)
   - Post to OSE forum (invite collaborators)

2. **Revenue Positive**:
   - Draft crowdfunding page (test value proposition)
   - Research grants (OSE partnership, solarpunk foundations)
   - Price clarity ($100 presale, $70 retail, $50 DIY kit)

3. **Root Cause**:
   - Build EMG test rig (validate core assumption)
   - Map salvage/e-waste sources (reduce supply chain dependency)
   - Document v2.0 roadmap (RISC-V transition)

### This Month

1. **First Dollar**:
   - Presell 10 units to friends/OSE community ($1,000 revenue)
   - Use revenue to buy components (bootstrap loop)
   - Document build (enable replication = disseminate)

2. **Agency Building**:
   - Run first assembly workshop (teach 5 people to build)
   - Charge $50/person (covers time, spreads knowledge)
   - Create video series (scale teaching beyond in-person)

3. **Gap Fill**:
   - Publish missing docs (EMG electrode placement guide)
   - Contribute to OSE wiki (Pip-Boy as coordination layer)
   - Release KiCad + FreeCAD files (open source the stack)

## 🔮 THE META HOW-TO (GPM Application)

### Omniscience Achieved

✅ **History**: Studied OSE governance evolution (Jan 6 → Jan 18)
✅ **Tech**: Research-verified components (ESP32, ADS1299, e-ink, CIGS)
✅ **Democracy**: Analyzed governance models (64% overlap with Marcin)

### Cross-Subsidy Model

📋 **Day Job**: Sell Pip-Boys + workshops (material production)
📋 **Revolution**: Open-source designs + teach replication (transformative work)

**Status**: Model designed, revenue not yet flowing (execution gap)

### Dissemination Plan

📋 **Once Free**: Achieved partial freedom (designs complete, not financially free yet)
📋 **Free Others**: Open-source all files, teach building, enable forking

---

## ⚖️ THE VERDICT

**GPM Alignment**: 5.5/10 (PARTIAL)

**Strong**:

- Root cause solution (sovereign tech stack)
- Dissemination mindset (open source, teaching)
- Cohort potential (OSE + Liz + village)

**Weak**:

- Revenue model not executed (no first dollar)
- Solo execution (no co-builders yet)
- Supply chain dependency (not fully root cause)

**Next Immediate Step to Advance the Mission**:

**🎯 EARN FIRST DOLLAR THIS WEEK**

Options:

1. Presell 1 Pip-Boy to friend/family ($100)
2. Run mini-workshop (teach LoRa mesh, $50 × 3 people = $150)
3. Apply for $500 OSE collaboration microgrant

**Why This Matters** (GPM Logic):

- Revenue = validation (people pay = idea has value)
- Revenue = fuel (buy components, no personal cash needed)
- Revenue = proof (can scale, not just hobby project)

**Commit**: By next session, report first dollar earned or crowdfunding page live.
