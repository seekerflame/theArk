## Mission Accomplished

Built complete launch system for **First Friday, February 6, 2026** (31 days from now).

### The 2-Merchant Closed Loop

```
YOU (Detailing) ←──────────→ RUDY (Hot Dogs)
     │                            │
     └──────── CUSTOMERS ─────────┘
```

**Economics**: Scalable from Day 1

- Labor → Mint AT
- Promos → Funded by poster
- Purchases → Transfer only

## Week 1 Actions (Jan 6-12)

| Day | Action | Owner |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Mon | Text Rudy | YOU |
| Tue | Demo kiosk on phone | YOU |
| Wed | Take photos for Rudy (earn 2 AT) | YOU |
| Thu | Print QR codes at Staples | YOU |
| Fri | Test full loop with Rudy | YOU + Rudy |

---

## Key Insights

1. **"Free labor" is bait. "Economic sovereignty" is the hook.**
   - Merchants save 30-50% on fees/extraction
   - Users own their wallets (no SSN, no bank)
   - AT = time-backed currency (1 AT = 1 hr verified labor)

2. **The closed loop works with just 2 merchants**
   - YOU earn AT from Rudy (photos, setup help)
   - Rudy earns AT from customers (hot dog sales)
   - Rudy spends AT with YOU (car detailing)

3. **Scalability is proven**
   - Labor mints AT (infinite human time)
   - Promos funded by poster (self-sustaining)
   - Transfers have no fees (infinite scale)
