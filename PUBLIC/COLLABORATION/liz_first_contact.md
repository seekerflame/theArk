# 👋 Liz - Practical Freedom Hardware for Your Solarpunk Platform

**TL;DR**: We're building open-source wearable + mesh hardware that could run your Solarpunk Utopia Platform. Want to collaborate?

---

## 🎯 What We're Building

**Pip-Boy Wearable**

- ESP32-based (runs PWAs offline)
- E-ink display (7-day battery)
- Solar charging
- BLE + WiFi + LoRa
- **Cost**: <$50 BOM
- **Purpose**: Wrist-worn mutual aid coordinator

**Meshtastic Integration**

- Long-range mesh (10km+ LoRa)
- Works without internet
- P2P sync ready
- Runs on salvaged Android/RPi
- **Purpose**: Community network backbone

---

## 🤝 Why This Matters to You

Your **Solarpunk Utopia Platform** needs hardware that:

- ✅ Works offline-first (we're offline-first)
- ✅ Runs on salvaged hardware (we design for salvage)
- ✅ Supports mesh networking (Meshtastic native)
- ✅ No corporate lock-in (open source, lifetime upgradeable)
- ✅ P2P sync (perfect for your Automerge CRDT)

**We're building the hardware layer for exactly what you're coding.**

## 💡 Immediate Collaboration Idea

**Pip-Boy Running Your Platform**:

1. We provide: Hardware design (BOM, CAD, assembly guide)
2. You provide: PWA optimized for 3.5" e-ink
3. Together: Wearable solarpunk mutual aid device

**Timeline**: Prototype in 6 weeks?

---

## 📦 What We Can Share

**Right Now**:

- Device specifications
- BOM estimates
- Technical feasibility analysis
- Integration approach for Automerge + Meshtastic

**Soon**:

- CAD files
- Assembly instructions
- Testing protocols

## ❓ Questions for You

1. Would your platform run well on ESP32? (limited RAM/CPU)
2. What's your minimum display requirements? (we're targeting 3.5" e-ink)
3. Is Meshtastic compatible with your P2P sync strategy?
4. Want to co-design the first prototype?
